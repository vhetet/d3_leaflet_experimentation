# d3_leaflet_experimentation

simple html + javascript + d3 + leaflet experimentation
Probably gonna rewrite that with react or vue at some point

This app show the destination for divvy trips from one divvy station.
The data is coming from [Chicago open data site](https://data.cityofchicago.org)

I used [this example](https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/bubblemap_leaflet_basic.html) from the d3-graph-gallery

To run this you need a web server. I used `serve` that I have installed globally on my machine.
If you want to do the same:

`npm i -g serve`

run the site

`serve`

It will serve your site on localhost:5000

But there are a lot more options available so use what you like. It's just a static site.
